## Introduction

Snake Game is a nostalgic arcade-style game where the objective is simple: control a snake to eat food, grow longer, and achieve the highest score possible. Be careful to avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body—those will end the game!

This version has been carefully designed to ensure smooth gameplay and a delightful user experience.
